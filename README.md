This is Courier Management Project that I made with the help of 3 more members as the 2nd semester's end project of Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering (ADSE).

This is still not complete so anyone who is downloading must ensure they have sufficient knowledge of core PHP so that they can tackle the lack of completion.

This project is made with core PHP, MySQL, and a template for HTML, CSS taken from the internet.
